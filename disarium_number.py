 Python program to check if an integer is a Disarium Number or not

 A number is called Disarium if sum of its digits powered with their 
 respective positions is equal to the number itself

 Example 1:
 n = 135
 Output:
 YES
 Explanation:
 135 -> 1^1 + 3^2 + 5^3 = 1 + 9 + 125 = 135

 Example 2:
 n = 89
 Output:
 YES
 Explanation:
 89 = 8^1 + 9^2 = 8 + 81 = 89
